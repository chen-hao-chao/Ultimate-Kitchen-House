# Ultimate Kitchen House

## introduction
This is the final project of the course Software Studio. We aimed to create a game that has similar game mechanism to Ultimate Chicken Hourse, which is a quite famous game on Steam. Since almost every horizontally-scrolling AVG has unchangable game map, and in case the player has accomplished certain sections, he/she would be unwilling to play it again. As a result, instead of building the map by game designers, the players in the game are required to build maps by themselves, which is regarded as one of the characteristics of this game.

## Architecture and Settings
- canvas sizeï¼š900*450
