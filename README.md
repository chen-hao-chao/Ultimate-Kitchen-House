# Ultimate Kitchen House

## intro
This this the final project of the course Software Studio. We aim to create a game that has similar game mechanism to Ultimate Chicken Hourse, which is a quite famous game on Steam. The main idea is that almost every horizontally-scrolling AVG has unchangable game map, and in case the player has accomplished certain sections, he/she will undesire to play it again. As a result, instead of building the game map in advance, we let the players to build the game map by themselves. (Obviously, this not only reduces tasks of game designers but also increase fun of players.)
